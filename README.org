* Senters

  This repository contains the theoretical and technical documentation
  of the senters project.

** Theoretical Framework

   Senters is developed with a theoretical framework that construes
   human social cognition and communication as an ongoing activity of
   cooperatively scaffolding attention.  This framework, which is
   builds upon the state of the art in ecologically situated cogntive
   science, serves as the motivation for the technical design of
   senters.

** Technical Framework

   Senters is a work in progress.  At present much of the active work
   of fleshing out details is happening in
   https://github.com/senters/wtd, which can be viewed as a primitive
   antecedent of the future senters framework.  This document is an
   attempt to specify in as much detail as possible the technical
   framework.
